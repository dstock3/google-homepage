The purpose of this exercise was to approximate Google's homepage based on my current working knowledge of HTML and CSS. I found the exercise to be useful in a number of respects. Specifically, it has helped me identify areas where my knowledge is lacking. For instance, while I believe I did successfully approximate the appearance of Google's homepage on a web browser, it's clear that my version is not responsive from a mobile standpoint. More practice with flexbox is needed. Media queries are another avenue I need to explore. On the plus side, this is the first project I've completed using version control throughout the entire process, and I found Git to be extremely intuitive and user friendly.
